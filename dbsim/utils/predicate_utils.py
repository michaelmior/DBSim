    """
    Decorrelates an AND expression into one or more parts, 
      where each part is (to the best effort) only related to one of the given nodes.
    
    If dupilcated parts are found, they will be automatically de-duplicated in the returning results, 
      for example, "X = 1 AND X = 1" after decorrelation will become Dict('X = 1': list(...)).

    This method is critical for rules like predicate-push-down. 
    Specifically, when an expression part is only related to one lower node, it can be pushed down to that node;
      while an expression part related to multiple lower nodes cannot be pushed down.
    
    Note that only AND expression can be decorrelated for pushing down each part individually, 
      while OR expression has to be pushed down (if it can be) as a whole. 

    Parameters
    -----------
    nodes: a list of plan nodes to check relevance with

    Return
    -----------
    a dict where each key is a predicate and each value is the indices of the related nodes in the input list.
