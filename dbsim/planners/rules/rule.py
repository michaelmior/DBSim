    Sets need two methods to make an object hashable: __hash__ and __eq__. 
    Two instances must return the same hash value when they are considered equal. 
    An instance is considered already present in a set if both the hash is present in the set 
        and the instance is considered equal to one of the instances with that same hash in the set.
    Therefore, to store rules in Optimizer.ruleSet, Rule must implement both of __hash__ and __eq__ methods.
    * If a class doesn't implement __eq__, the default object.__eq__ is used instead, 
        which only returns true if 'obj1 is obj2' is also true. 
        In other words, by default two instances are only considered equal if they are the exact same instance.
