  Logical cost.

  The 'cost' in general query optimization normally refers to the cost of physical plan,

  Unlike that kind of cost, 'logical cost' is computed purely based on the logical plan.
  For example, the total number of rows in all the intermediate results. 
  Logical cost needs the general stat info, like number of rows in the input relations, 
    but has nothing to do with the physical implementation.
